# Secrets
Secrets in this flakes are managed with sops-nix in the [modules.common.sops](/modules/common/sops.nix) module.

## Keys
### How to make a key with your personal SSH key
I did this for my master key.

Create one with this command: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "c@orangc.net"`.
When prompted for a passphrase, give none. This is important.

Next, we'll make ourself an age key.

`ssh-to-age -private-key -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 > ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`

Then, run `age-keygen -y ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` to get the public age key, which goes into [`.sops.yaml`](../.sops.yaml).


### Per-machine keys (user)
On each machine, we need an age key. These _admin keys are so that you can edit the secrets...

Run `age-keygen -o ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`.

Then, run `age-keygen -y ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` to get the public age key, which goes into [`.sops.yaml`](../.sops.yaml), named under the respective hostname followed by `_admin` (e.g., `anacreon_admin`).

### Per-machine keys (server)
Here, you don't need to generate an SSH key, as we're using the machine's host SSH key which is autogenerated.

Run `cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub | ssh-to-age`.

That will return the public age key, which goes into [`.sops.yaml`](../.sops.yaml) named under the respective hostname followed by `_server` (e.g., `anacreon_server`).

These machine specific keys do not need to be backed up, unlike the *master key* which you should create and place inside a USB or other safe location.

## Interacting with the module
Example `secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
my-secret: test
nested:
  secret: test
```

Example module usage:

```nix
modules.common.secrets.my-secret = {};
modules.common.secrets."nested/secret" = {
    # All below options are optional.
    path = "/home/orangc/secret";
    owner = "orangc";
    group = "fumos";
    mode = "0440";
};
```

## Conclusion
Remember to refer back to the [`sops-nix`](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) documentation when confused.
