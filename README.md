Modular NixOS configuration for my machines. Very lightweight! A fresh installation of this flake (with the modules enabled in [anacreon](./hosts/anacreon/config.nix)) will be *18 gigabytes*, which isn't bad at all in my opinion.

Hosts:
- anacreon (PC ~ Hyprland)
- helicon (portable USB, meant to be plugged in to any machine ~ Hyprland)
- urithiru (homelab/server)
