Modular NixOS configuration for my machines. Very [lightweight](https://orangc.net/n/disk-usage)! A fresh installation of this flake will be *17 gigabytes*, which isn't bad at all in my opinion.

Hosts:
- anacreon (PC ~ Hyprland)
- helicon (portable USB, meant to be plugged in to any machine ~ Hyprland)
- urithiru (WIP; homelab)
